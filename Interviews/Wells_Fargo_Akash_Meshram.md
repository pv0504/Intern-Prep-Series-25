## About Me

Hey! I’m **Akash Meshram**, currently a **Technology Analyst Intern at Wells Fargo, Hyderabad**.

## About Wells Fargo

Wells Fargo visited **IIT Delhi** for recruitment, offering two roles:
* **Technology Analyst**
* **Quant Analyst** *(intended only for dual degree students)*

---

## Online Assessment (OA)

The OA conducted by Wells Fargo was quite comprehensive. As far as I remember, it lasted around **1.5 to 2 hours** and covered:

* Basic **reasoning**, **puzzles**, and **comprehension** questions
* **Two coding problems**:

  * One was very basic
  * The second was based on **graph traversal**

**Overall Difficulty**: Easy to Moderate

---

## Interview Rounds

Here comes the **real game changer** — the interview rounds! Roughly **15–18 candidates** were shortlisted after the OA.

Wells Fargo had **3 interview rounds**:

1. **Technical Round 1**
2. **Technical Round 2**
3. **HR Round** *(which honestly wasn’t much of a round 😉)*

### Tech Round 1

A fairly basic round. The interviewer began with a simple puzzle and then discussed my **projects mentioned in the CV**.

> 💡 **Tip**: Be thoroughly familiar with everything on your CV. You shouldn't fumble while explaining any point.

Since my projects were CS-focused, the interviewer showed great interest. So, ensure your CV sparks curiosity and drives the interview discussion. Otherwise the interviewer would ask more questions that he/she has prepared (which might not be favourable to us.)

### Tech Round 2

This round was labeled 'Technical', but honestly, it felt more like an **HR-styled round** (at least for me).

The interviewer kicked off with **tricky logic-based questions** — not hard, but clever.

#### Questions:

**Q1.** How would you print a statement in C++ without using a `;` in the printing code?
**A1.** `if(cout << "It was surprising for me!! 😯") {}`

**Q2.** How would you print numbers 1 to 50 without using integers in the code?
**A2.** use ASCII values of chars to figure out (This was not that impressive 😒)

He asked one more similar puzzle and then shifted to **non-technical questions** — about my interests, college culture, programming habits, etc.

Basically, he played **devil’s advocate** in every response. I think the idea was to test my **confidence**, and **communication skills**. He expected me to defend my thoughts respectfully, even if they didn’t align with his — agree samrtly, yet present your point.

### HR Round

Quite chill round 😄

* Just **two questions**:
  1. Did you attend the PPT by Wells?            2. What do you know about Wells Fargo?

After that, it was mostly a formality. The HR explained about ,Office locations, Compensation, Perks & benefits, and that was it!

## My Preparation Strategy

My prep journey was pretty standard:

* **During the summer**, I focused on **Codeforces** contests — both live and virtual, almost daily
* Later, I shifted my focus to **LeetCode Medium-level problems**, based on advice from peers
* I prioritized topics that are frequently tested in OAs & interviews like **Graphs** and **DP**

## Overall Tips from Me

### 1. Make an Impactful CV

* Make your CV **engaging and review-ready**
* **Share it** with seniors(can ping me as well) and batchmates for feedback
* Use **AI tools wisely** to enhance your CV — but don’t overdo it
* Be **110% clear** about everything mentioned in your CV

### 2. Confidence and Communication skills are very imp. 

* Besides tech skills, **confidence and calmness** are key
* Don’t get distracted and don't compare yourself with anyone, stay focused on your own prep and **give your 100%**

### 3. Practice Intros

* Practice your **interview introduction** multiple times
* I used to rehearse in front of a mirror — it helps organize thoughts
* Have a **precise, written intro** ready

### 4. Ask Back Questions

* Most interviewers ask: "Do you have any questions for me?", Don’t waste this opportunity by saying, *“No, it’s fine”* (google a few questions of this sort before actual war.)
* Have a **few thoughtful questions** prepared in advance — it shows curiosity and leaves good impression.

### 5. Code Relentlessly

* Even if you don't feel like it, **keep coding**
* Wells didn’t stress coding heavily, but many other companies do
