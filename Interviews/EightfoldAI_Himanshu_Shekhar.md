Hi, I am Himanshu Shekhar, a senior year student in department of Computer Science. I am an Engineering Intern at Eightfold AI. I will be explaining the whole process of selection.

### Online Assessment (OA)

1-hour OA with 2 questions:
- The first question was a **DP problem** of moderate difficulty. Although I could not correctly guess the dp relation and therefore wrote a basic O(n^2) code and made few optimizations based on observations about the question. It wasn't linear but enough to correctly pass the test cases in the given time limit.
- The second was based on **graphs**, a modification on the pairwise shortest distance between all nodes. It was quite lengthy and somewhat difficult. For solving such questions, you need a good grasp on algorithms.

### Interview Experience

The interview consisted of **3 rounds** â€“ 2 technical rounds and 1 HR round.

####  Round 1: Technical
I was asked two questions in the first round:
- A moderate **CP problem** (Greedy Approach and optimization using Priority Queues).
- A discussion on my SURA project.

However, the coding was to be done on paper - I had made mistakes while writing and was told to find bugs quickly and debug.

####  Round 2: Design

- The round started with general discussion of the CV. Then the discussion headed to some scheduling issues that systems face and then I was asked to write Topological Sorting in Python (I struggled in python but since I had mentioned in my CV that I knew Python, I had to proceed). Similar to the first round, writing in paper, finding bugs and then debug.

- The second question was "You are an employee in a company that designs and manufactures Snakes and Ladders, how would you design the board to maximize the company's profit ?" It was very vague at first, so I cleared all my doubts about the question (never hesitate to ask questions!) The question turned out to be a ML question involving designing features(mx, min diff. b/w two snakes, ladders; length of largest snake, ladder; number of snakes, ladders; diff. b/w number of snakes, ladders, etc.), target(optimum no. of moves in which a game ends, profit=>more sale=>interesting board=>optimum no. of moves) and then run Monte Carlo Simulations on randomly generated boards and finding the best features.

####  Round 3: HR

Not a typical HR Round, I was just asked about my credentials and everyone who got here were offered.

### Preparation Strategy

- Don't just do CP. Try to understand variations and use of Data Structures and Algorithms.
- I would highly recommend CSES. (I never liked Codeforces)
- Brush up concepts from Computer Architecture also.
- Design your CV properly
