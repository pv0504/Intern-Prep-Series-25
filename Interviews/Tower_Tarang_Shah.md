# Tower Research Capital Internship Journey

## Introduction
- **Name**: Tarang Shah  
- **Year & Major**: Fourth-year CSE student at IIT Delhi  
- **Current Location**: London (internship at Tower Research Capital)

I will briefly describe my journey to securing this internship, share my experiences, and offer personal advice along the way. I won’t focus on preparation details, as excellent blogs by our seniors already cover that thoroughly.

## Online Assessment (OA) Period
In the first two weeks of the application process, you’ll take back-to-back online tests from various companies. I would encourage you to give tests most of the companies who are offering the role you are looking for since it’s fun smashing tests of different companies :) On a serious note, you would already have done the prep required for the OA’s and it is always good to be shortlisted for many companies since you would have more options to pick from later.

> **Tip:** If an OA goes badly, shake it off and move on. Each assessment is a fresh opportunity.

### Company-wise OA Breakdown
#### Indian Quants
- **Quant**: Strengthen combinatorics and probability.  
- **Software**: CP-only test—practice Codeforces and CSES.

#### Optiver
- **General Test**: Mental math (e.g., “80 in 8”), sequence guessing, and reflex mini-games.  
- **Quant**: One-on-one round testing guessing, mental math, and probability.  
- **Software**: Standard coding test; interviews may follow.

#### Tower Research Capital
- **Combined Test**: Mix of coding and quant questions designed to impose time pressure.

#### Jane Street
- **Quant**: Online probability and combinatorics test.  
- **Software**: Coding test emphasizing readability and clarity.

#### Da Vinci
- **Quant**: Numerical test covering probability and combinatorics.

#### Citadel
- **Quant**: No separate test conducted.  
- **Software**: Standard coding test.

> **Note:** Test formats may change, but core preparation remains focused on DSA, combinatorics, and probability.

## Final Day Interviews
- **Preference Submission:** Fill in your top 4–5 role preferences in the OCS portal.  
  - Have at least one backup role you’re confident about.

- **My Preferences:**  
  1. Tower roles  
  2. Jane Street roles  
  3. *Backup:* Graviton QR (above Optiver SWE and Citadel SWE)

- **Interview Day Recap:**  
  - Got a good night’s sleep.  
  - Interviews began around **7 AM**.  
  - **JS Quant:** In-person game with observations, guessing, and rationale.  
  - **JS Software:** Creative problem—discuss, design, and code the solution with the interviewer.  
  - **Tower:** Systems design, CP questions, quant puzzles, and CV project discussion.  
  - Interviewers were relaxed and friendly.

I missed my Graviton slot due to earlier delays and ended up interviewing for three roles. Ultimately, I was thrilled to receive an offer from Tower’s North Moore team.

## Closing Advice
- **Prepare thoroughly**, but lean on peer discussions for OA problems.  
- **Communicate clearly**—talk through your thought process.  
- **Stay calm** and honest; admit when you don’t know something.  
- **Take care of your health** during this intense period.  
- **Be yourself** and make thoughtful choices—you’ll earn your success.
