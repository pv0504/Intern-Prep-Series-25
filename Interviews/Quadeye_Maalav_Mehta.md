## ðŸ“‹ About the Recruitment Process

Quadeye doesnâ€™t conduct a **dedicated internship test** (though it does have a **scholarship test**â€”performing well in that is highly correlated with receiving an internship offer).

The recruitment process for internships included:

> Based on my experience, **CGPA** and **department rank** were the key factors in getting shortlisted.

### Interview Day:

Followed by:
- An **informal conversation** with one of the **partners at Quadeye**

## ðŸ§  Preparation Tips

Due to my **research internship** and low surrounding FOMO, I couldnâ€™t prepare extensively. Hereâ€™s what I did:

- **PuzzledQuant**: Used for practicing puzzles and probability questions.
- **QuantGuide** *(recommended)*: Has a vast and well-organized problem setâ€”ideal if you have more time.

### Programming:
I didnâ€™t prepare much, but based on peer feedback:
- **CSES** is a solid platform, especially for:
  - **Dynamic Programming**
  - **Graphs**

## ðŸ’¡ Advice for Future Candidates
