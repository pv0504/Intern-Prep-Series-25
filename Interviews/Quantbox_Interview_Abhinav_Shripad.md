### Introduction

I am Abhinav Rajesh Shripad, 2022 Batch CSE student. I am interning at Quantbox, Singapore Office as a Quantitaive Trader.

### Preparation 

Mostly did CSES, bit of leetcode. Would suggest to revise COL106 and MTL106 things. DP, Graphs are the things to focus on. For quant prep, do the Brainstellar, Heard on the street and few of the standard quant books. 

### Interview and Shortlisting
From my experience CGPA was not a major criteria for shortlisting. But only circuital students were allowed. Good performance in the test was the prime criteria. 

In Interview, I was asked only quant puzzles, nothing systems. The interviewer gave hints too. Multiple interviewers were there who asked different problems. I didn't have any HR round, or if I had any, I could not recognize it. The interviewers were very friendly, and not very formal. One could(should) think loudly while solving the problems. I found this very good. But is almost true for almost many of the quants. I would suggest students to consider the problem solving as a discussion with a fellow classmate and not a very important interview. 

In general, I would also suggest students, not to fake their knowledge. Very easy to catch.
