Hola peeps!  
I am **Aditya Sahu**, currently an **engineering intern at Eightfold AI, Bangalore**. Eightfold usually comes only for the **Engineering Intern** role, but last year it also hired students for the **Product Analyst** role (mostly a non-tech role). Iâ€™ll be touching on the **preparation**, **OA**, and **interview experience** for the Engineering Intern role.

### Online Assessment (OA)

There was a 1-hour OA with 2 questions:
- The first question was a **DP problem** of moderate difficulty.
- The second was based on **graphs**, actually a modification of the **Floyd-Warshall algorithm**. I would rate it moderate to difficult.

### Interview Experience

The interview consisted of **3 rounds** â€“ 2 technical rounds and 1 HR round.

#### ðŸ”¹ Round 1: Technical
The first round was mostly **CP-based**.  
I was asked 2 questions:
- A standard **easy DSA problem** to begin with (Finding Next Greater Element).
- A **greedy problem**.

This round was relatively easy and most candidates cleared it.

#### ðŸ”¹ Round 2: Technical

- The second round began with a short **Q&A on the resume**. I was asked to explain one of my projects and answer a few follow-up questions.
- Then I was asked a **DSA problem**. The round lasted for around **45 minutes** and they expected a **deep discussion**.
  - Strong emphasis on optimizing time and space complexity.
  - Also asked to specify states of the program, reducing possible redundancy (obviously not all in the first go).

- Many students were asked a **design problem** in this round, like:
  - Designing **Board for Snake and Ladder** or a **Chess Game**.
  - Youâ€™re not expected to write code, but describe the **classes**, **functions**, and **state transitions** involved.

#### ðŸ”¹ Round 3: HR

The HR round was mostly a formality, and no one was eliminated here.  
Note that though this is the case with most companies, there are SDE's which do eliminate people in the HR round, so be careful.

### Preparation Strategy

- I mostly practiced on **Codeforces**, solving problems and giving regular contests.
- Towards the later part of preparation, I solved important questions from **Striverâ€™s A to Z SDE Sheet**.
- I also practiced key topics like **Trees**, **Graphs**, and **DP** from **CSES**.

Many SDE companies also ask **MCQs** from:
- **C++ OOPS**
- **Computer Architecture**
- **Computer Networks**
- **Operating Systems**
- **DBMS** (mainly SQL)

You can study C++ OOPS from **online resources** (GFG has a good set of questions).  
For core CS subjects, if you haven't already studied them, Iâ€™d suggest not spending too much time there â€” they usually have **low weightage** and donâ€™t make a big difference.
