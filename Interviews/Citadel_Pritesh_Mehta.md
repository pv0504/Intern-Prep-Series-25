# Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm **Pritesh Mehta**, currently working as a **Software Developer Intern at Citadel**. I wanted to share a detailed breakdown of my OCS (On-Campus Selection) day to help you navigate it smoothly.

## ðŸŒž The OCS Day Structure

The OCS day is split into two time slots:

* **Morning slot:** 6:00 AM â€“ 12:00 PM
* **Afternoon slot:** 3:00 PM â€“ 9:00 PM

### ðŸ”‘ Essentials to Bring

* Updated **CV**
* **Laptop** (if you have online interviews)
* **Headphones** (for online interviews)
* **Phone** (Youâ€™ll receive updates like shortlists and interview timings on **WhatsApp**)

### ðŸ§  General Advice

1. **Arrive Early:**

   * A long queue forms at **6:00 AM** and **3:00 PM**. Enter the OCS building as early as possible to avoid delays.

2. **Interview Flexibility:**

   * Although itâ€™s said that every interview is compulsory, **you can skip** interviews if you're not interested or arent able to manage time for it.
   * You can also **skip top-4 preference companies** if you want to. And sit in the company not in your top 4.

3. **Time Management is Crucial:**

   * Each interview is said to be **45 minutes**, but most companies **extend** the interview and try to **hold** you longer.
   * Don't hesitate to leave an interview **politely** if theyâ€™re not offering you an immediate result and you have another interview.
   * Ask directly: *"Are you giving me an offer now?"* â€” if not, move on.

4. **Interview Offers and Outcomes:**

   * Some companies give **instant offers**, some later, and some may just keep you as backup.
   * Donâ€™t get discouraged if a company doesn't offer you anything.

5. **Presence of Mind:**

   * Most of the students can only give 2-3 companies properly even if they are shortlist for 4+. Timing often wonâ€™t match whatâ€™s officially provided. Stay alert and adaptable.

## ðŸ“– My OCS Day Timeline

Hereâ€™s how my OCS Day played out:

### 6:00 AM â€“ Entry

Entered the OCS building and joined the long queue.

### 6:15 AM â€“ 7:30 AM â€“ **Interview 1: QuantBox**

* Questions on **DSA** and **System Design**.
* They tried to hold me longer, but I told them I had a higher preference company next â€” **Citadel**.
* Pro Tip: Donâ€™t be scared to mention your preferences. Interviewers usually understand and respect it.

### 7:30 AM â€“ 8:00 AM â€“ **Interview 2: Citadel**

* Focused on **BFS**.
* Very formal and finished on time.

### 8:00 AM â€“ 9:30 AM â€“ **Interview 3: Tower**

* Topics included **Competitive Programming**, **Probability**, and **Markets**.
* Again, they tried to hold me, but I politely mentioned my next interview.
* the OCS volenteer there was very helpful and helped me to leave the interview.

### 9:30 AM â€“ 10:30 AM â€“ **Interview 4: Quadeye**

* Asked about **Probability**, **DSA**, and **System Design**.
* I assumed I couldnâ€™t skip it â€” in hindsight, I couldâ€™ve skipped as I felt confident about QuantBox.
* Funny moment: I left mid-interview when they switched interviewers! ðŸ˜…

### 10:30 AM â€“ 11:15 AM â€“ **Citadel Round 2**

* Got shortlisted on **WhatsApp** at 10:15 AM during Quadeye.
* Interview focused on implementing **Topological Sort**.

### 11:15 AM â€“ 12:30 PM â€“ **QuantBox Round 2**

* More difficult **System Design** questions.
* I had **7 interviewers back-to-back**!
* Got an **on-the-spot offer** at **12:30 PM** ðŸŽ‰

### 12:45 PM â€“ 1:30 PM â€“ **Citadel Round 3**

* Noticed shortlist message **after 12:30 PM**, thought the round wouldnâ€™t happen. Since officially OCS slot ends at 12:00 PM.
* OCS volunteers helped arrange it.
* Questions about my **projects** and **resume**.
* I was **exhausted**, couldnâ€™t remember prepared HR answers, so I answered **honestly** and I guess it worked in my favor.

### 3:30 PM â€“ **Citadel Offer!** ðŸŽ‰

* Although OCSâ€™s official deadline was 1:30 PM, I received Citadel's offer later in the afternoon.
