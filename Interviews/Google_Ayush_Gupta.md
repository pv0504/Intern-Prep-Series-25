## üìù Interview Process

There were **2 rounds**, each lasting approximately **30‚Äì35 minutes**, focused primarily on **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

### üîπ Round 1:
- Involved a problem solvable using **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**
- While other approaches were possible, **DSU was the cleanest and easiest**

### üîπ Round 2:
- Based on **Tree Traversal (DFS/BFS)** and its variations
- The interviewer began with a **simpler version** of the problem and then introduced **incremental complexity**

> The **focus** was on writing **clean and correct code**.  
> Coding was done in a **blank document**, so no IDE or syntax highlighting.  
> The **interviewer was helpful** and guided when necessary.

## üß† Preparation Strategy

Here‚Äôs how I prepared:

1. **Competitive Programming (CP)**  
   - Regularly practiced on **Codeforces** and **CodeChef**

2. **LeetCode**  
   - Focused on the last **1‚Äì2 months** before the interviews

3. **Striver‚Äôs DSA Sheet**  
   - Not done fully; focused on **important and frequent problems**

4. **CSES Problem Set**  
   - Prioritized **important sections**

5. **Miscellaneous Practice**  
   - Solved **random good problems** found on the internet

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Tips

- Don‚Äôt ignore **lesser-used data structures** like **DSU** ‚Äî they can appear unexpectedly
- Keep attempting **live contests** to build **speed and confidence under pressure**
