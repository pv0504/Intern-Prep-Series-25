# 🧭 My Internship Preparation Journey – DE Shaw

Hi, I am **Saumitra Garg**. This document outlines my preparation and experience while applying for the **Technology Developer internship** role at **D. E. Shaw India** through **IIT Delhi**. It includes the company overview, my online assessment and interview experience, and some preparation tips for future applicants.

## 🏢 About D. E. Shaw

D. E. Shaw is traditionally a **hedge fund**, but is currently transitioning into more of a **FinTech organisation**. From IIT Delhi, it hires for its **front office roles**, specifically for the **Technology Developer** position across its three Indian offices: **Hyderabad**, **Gurugram**, and **Bangalore**, with the **Hyderabad office being the largest and main hub**.

### ✅ Good Points:
- Excellent work culture – employee satisfaction is given high priority.
- Flexibility in working hours and pace.
- Easy connect with senior leadership.
- Each intern is assigned a personal mentor, usually a well-experienced person, who guides them throughout the internship.
- Intern projects are individual — no two interns have the same project.
- Projects are generally impactful and of real value to the firm.

### ⚠️ Negative Point:
- Project allocation is random. You may get something you've never worked on (and possibly didn’t want to), while others might get familiar or preferred areas.  
That said, there’s always a good amount of learning involved, regardless of the project.

## 🧠 Online Assessment (OA) Experience

The OA round had a **time-pressured pattern** — each question had a **specific time allocation**, though I don't remember exactly if time carry-forward was there or not.

- **Total duration**: ~1 hour 20 minutes  
  - ~20 minutes each for the first two questions  
  - ~40 minutes for the last question (approximate timings)

### 📌 Key Highlights:
- 3 DSA problems of increasing difficulty.
- Time-specific slots for each question.
- One question was definitely **DP**, another was likely **brute force + optimization**, and topics overall included **Greedy**, **Bitmasking**, and **DP**.
- The round was both about how well you can **perform under strict time limits** and **gradual difficulty of questions**.

## 🗣️ Interview Experience

There were **2 interview rounds**, both conducted online.

- **Round 1**: ~30 minutes  
- **Round 2**: ~20 minutes

### 💬 Round 1 – CP + C++
- Started with **introduction** and discussion around **projects**.
- Interviewer showed interest in a **Cache Simulator** I had built as part of the **COL216** course — asked a few questions (not too in-depth).
- Then moved on to a **Graph problem**, likely around **cycle detection**.
- After solving, I was asked how I’d implement it in **C++**.
- Discussion then flowed into C++ concepts, especially:
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Smart pointers**

### 🧑‍💻 Round 2 – System Design in C++
- Was asked to **design a Banking System** class in C++.
- The interviewer clearly explained the **requirements and functionality** they wanted.
- The interview was **interactive and iterative** — I modified the design based on **live feedback**.
- This round was **completely centered around system design in C++**, nothing else.

### 👥 Interviewer Interaction
- Each round had **two interviewers**, but only one would actively speak.
- All interviewers were **very supportive and knowledgeable** — they were able to understand and engage with your **thought process**, which is really important during such discussions.

## 🛠️ Preparation Tips

### 📘 For OA and CP
Focus on **standard topics** for internship OAs:
- Dynamic Programming  
- Graphs  
- Bitmasking, etc.  
Practice from any common platforms (**Leetcode**, **Codeforces**, etc.) — the **usual resources are more than enough**.

### 🧠 For Interviews
Be thorough with **C++ fundamentals**:
- OOPs concepts, especially **inheritance**
- **Pointers and smart pointers**
