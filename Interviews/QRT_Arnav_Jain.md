# QRT Quant Developer Internship

## Introduction
Hi, I’m **Arnav Jain**, currently a Quant Developer at QRT’s Mumbai office.

## Online Assessment
- **Sections:**  
  1. **Coding** (2 questions; easy–moderate difficulty; focused on algorithms and CP rather than deep DSA)  
  2. **Quant** (general probability questions and puzzles; relatively straightforward)  
- **Key Point:**  
  - Since the test wasn’t overly challenging, **solving almost all questions correctly** was crucial.  
  - **CGPA** also played a significant role in shortlisting.

## Onsite Experience
1. **Breakfast & Briefing**  
   - Met team members, seniors, HR, and leadership.  
   - Received an overview of the company culture and team structure.  
2. **Interviews**  
   - **Round 1:** General discussion about aspirations, past projects, and work experience.  
   - **Round 2:** Technical questions with on-the-spot problem-solving and pseudocode writing.  
   - Most candidates had two rounds (some had only one).

## Preparation
- **Coding & Algorithms:**  
  - Solved problems on **CSES**.  
  - Regularly participated in **Codeforces** contests.  
- **Probability & Puzzles:**  
  - **Xinfeng Zhou** puzzle collections.  
  - *50 Challenging Problems in Probability*  
  - **Brainstellar** puzzles.

## Personal Advice
- **Deep Interests Matter:**  
  - Extra research can spark memorable discussions (e.g., reading a paper that your interviewer knows).  
- **CV Quality:**  
  - Structure thoughtfully and highlight projects clearly—your CV may drive the first interview.  
- **Well-Being:**  
  - Back-to-back tests and interviews can be exhausting.  
  - Schedule breaks and prioritize your health and mental well-being.
