This summer, I had the opportunity to intern with **ITC Limited** under their prestigious **KITES Internship Program**, specifically with the **Fresh Fruits & Vegetables team** under the **Agri Business Division**. Despite the nature of the domain, I worked on a very exciting machine learning project (which I unfortunately can‚Äôt disclose for obvious reasons üôÇ). The experience gave me valuable insights into the functioning of one of India‚Äôs largest and most diversified conglomerates and pushed me to think critically, communicate effectively, and apply my technical and project skills in a real-world business setting.

### **Selection Process**

The entire process had four main stages:

#### **1\. Aptitude Test (Online ‚Äì Home Proctored)**

The first stage was an online aptitude test conducted on a third-party platform. It included questions on quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning, data interpretation, and verbal ability. It was time-bound and tested both accuracy and speed. This round happened well before the official placement interviews at IITD.

#### **2\. Group Discussion (GD)**

Shortlisted candidates were invited for a GD, conducted by a two-member panel. The format was case-based: a random scenario was given, and the group had to discuss and arrive at a conclusion. This happened the evening before the official interview day at IITD.

* Our topic was one of the well-known scenarios commonly found online, so prior research helped.

* The focus was on structured thinking, clarity, and collaborative problem-solving not just how much you speak.

* I prepared for GDs by practicing multiple case discussions with my peers, especially those from DebSoc and consulting prep groups (always good to have them around for solid feedback).

* In the actual GD, I tried to add value by summarizing key points, helping the group converge on ideas, and using simple frameworks when needed without sounding too rehearsed.

#### **3\. Technical Interview**

Candidates who cleared the GD moved on to a technical round with the same two-member panel. This round happened the same night as the GD.

* This wasn‚Äôt a generic Q\&A. Instead, we were given open-ended, real-world problems. For example, I was asked how to monitor labor efficiency in a factory setting. A friend of mine was asked how they‚Äôd design a way to close a bottle cap.

* I presented multiple solutions, compared them based on cost and feasibility (relatively, not exact numbers), and made sure to justify every point I made.

* One key thing: whatever you say, they‚Äôll dig deeper into it so avoid throwing buzzwords without knowing them inside out.

#### **4\. Final Interview (HR \+ Technical Blend)**

The final round was supposed to be an HR interview, but it turned out to be a mix of HR and technical.

* The panel had two senior leaders from different verticals within ITC.

* They asked standard HR questions like ‚ÄúAre you open to relocating?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy ITC?‚Äù

* But they also went into the details of my CV, especially around my robotics club stint (make sure to have a clear explanation if you left something after a year) and my technical projects, too focused on RoboCon volunteering.

* They were clearly evaluating not just technical skills, but also how well you‚Äôd fit into the company adaptability, business thinking, and cultural alignment.

### **Preparation Strategy**

I prepped systematically across three areas:

#### **1\. Group Discussion (GD)**

* Practiced GDs with peers under timed conditions.

* I learned to structure my thoughts using simple tools like SWOT, 5Ws, etc.

* Focused on listening actively, not dominating, and helping the group move towards a conclusion.

#### **2\. CV and Project Readiness**

* Did a deep dive into each project on my CV and looked at the motivation, decisions, constraints, and outcomes.

* Prepared to explain both the big picture and technical details.
