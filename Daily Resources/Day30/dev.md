        buf->in = (buf->in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
        buf->count++;

**Your Mission**:
1. **Multi-Process Server (Fork-based)**:
   - Fork new process for each client connection
   - Implement proper process cleanup (avoid zombies)
   - Handle server shutdown gracefully
   - Measure memory usage per connection

**Sample Implementation Framework**:

**Multi-Process Server (C)**:
```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <signal.h>

void handle_client(int client_socket) {
    // Process-specific client handling
    char buffer[1024];
    ssize_t bytes = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
    
    // Simple HTTP response
    char *response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
                    "Content-Length: 13\r\n"
                    "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n"
                    "Hello, World!";
    
    send(client_socket, response, strlen(response), 0);
    close(client_socket);
    exit(0);  // Child process exits
}

void sigchld_handler(int sig) {
    // Reap zombie children
    while (waitpid(-1, NULL, WNOHANG) > 0);
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGCHLD, sigchld_handler);
    
    int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    // ... bind and listen setup ...
    
    while (1) {
        int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);
        
        pid_t pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) {
            // Child process
            close(server_socket);
            handle_client(client_socket);
        } else if (pid > 0) {
            // Parent process
            close(client_socket);
        } else {
            perror("fork failed");
        }
    }
}
```

typedef struct {
    int client_socket;
    struct sockaddr_in client_addr;
} client_info_t;

typedef struct {
    pthread_mutex_t mutex;
    int active_connections;
    long long total_requests;
} server_stats_t;

server_stats_t stats = {
    .mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER,
    .active_connections = 0,
    .total_requests = 0
};

void* handle_client_thread(void* arg) {
    client_info_t *client_info = (client_info_t*)arg;
    int client_socket = client_info->client_socket;
    
    // Update statistics
    pthread_mutex_lock(&stats.mutex);
    stats.active_connections++;
    stats.total_requests++;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&stats.mutex);
    
    // Handle client request
    char buffer[1024];
    recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
    
    char *response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
                    "Content-Length: 13\r\n"

                    "Hello, World!";
    
    send(client_socket, response, strlen(response), 0);
    close(client_socket);
    
    // Update statistics
    pthread_mutex_lock(&stats.mutex);
    stats.active_connections--;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&stats.mutex);
    
    free(client_info);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    // ... bind and listen setup ...
    
    while (1) {
        client_info_t *client_info = malloc(sizeof(client_info_t));
        socklen_t addr_len = sizeof(client_info->client_addr);
        
        client_info->client_socket = accept(server_socket, 
            (struct sockaddr*)&client_info->client_addr, &addr_len);
        
        pthread_t thread;
        if (pthread_create(&thread, NULL, handle_client_thread, client_info) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_create failed");
            close(client_info->client_socket);
            free(client_info);
        } else {
            pthread_detach(thread);  // Auto-cleanup
        }
    }
}
```

**Thread Pool Implementation**:

typedef struct {
    pthread_t *threads;
    int thread_count;
    pthread_mutex_t queue_mutex;
    pthread_cond_t queue_cond;
    client_info_t **task_queue;
    int queue_size, queue_front, queue_rear, queue_count;
    int shutdown;
} thread_pool_t;

void* worker_thread(void* arg) {
    thread_pool_t *pool = (thread_pool_t*)arg;
    
    while (1) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&pool->queue_mutex);
        
        while (pool->queue_count == 0 && !pool->shutdown) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&pool->queue_cond, &pool->queue_mutex);
        }
        
        if (pool->shutdown) {
            pthread_mutex_unlock(&pool->queue_mutex);
            break;
        }
        
        client_info_t *client_info = pool->task_queue[pool->queue_front];
        pool->queue_front = (pool->queue_front + 1) % pool->queue_size;
        pool->queue_count--;
        
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&pool->queue_mutex);

**Skills Practiced**:
- Real-world application of process vs thread models
- Performance benchmarking under different loads
- Resource management (memory, file descriptors, CPU)
- Concurrent programming patterns and anti-patterns
- System-level programming and debugging

## Tips for Success

### Understanding the Fundamentals
- **Memory Models**: Processes have separate address spaces, threads share memory
- **Creation Overhead**: Processes are expensive to create, threads are lightweight
- **Communication**: IPC for processes, shared memory for threads
- **Fault Isolation**: Process crashes don't affect others, thread crashes can kill the process

### Debugging Concurrent Programs
- **Use Proper Tools**: GDB for debugging, Valgrind for memory errors, ThreadSanitizer for race conditions
- **Reproducible Bugs**: Add logging, use deterministic scheduling when possible
- **Start Simple**: Debug with single thread/process first, then scale up
- **Understand Timing**: Race conditions often disappear when debugging

### Performance Considerations
- **Context Switching**: Threads switch faster than processes
- **Memory Usage**: Processes use more memory due to separate address spaces  
- **Scalability**: Threads scale better on multi-core systems
- **I/O Bound vs CPU Bound**: Different optimal strategies

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Race Conditions**: Always protect shared data with synchronization
- **Deadlocks**: Consistent lock ordering, timeout mechanisms
- **Resource Leaks**: Proper cleanup of threads, processes, and synchronization objects
- **Over-Threading**: Too many threads can hurt performance due to context switching

### Best Practices
- **Design for Concurrency**: Think about data sharing and synchronization early
- **Use Higher-Level Abstractions**: Thread pools, async/await patterns
- **Measure Performance**: Profile before optimizing
- **Test Thoroughly**: Stress testing, race condition detection tools

## Quick Reference

### Process vs Thread Comparison
```
PROCESSES:
✓ Strong isolation (crash safety)
✓ Separate memory spaces
✓ Better security boundaries
✓ Easier debugging
✗ Higher memory usage
✗ Slower creation/context switching
✗ Complex communication (IPC)
✗ Limited by system resources

THREADS:
✓ Lightweight creation
✓ Fast context switching
✓ Shared memory communication
✓ Better resource utilization
✗ Shared crash domain
✗ Race conditions possible
✗ Complex synchronization
✗ Debugging difficulties
```

### Synchronization Primitives
```
MUTEX (Mutual Exclusion):
- Protects critical sections
- Only one thread can hold lock
- Use for short, simple critical sections

SEMAPHORE:
- Counting resource manager
- N threads can proceed simultaneously
- Use for resource pools, producer-consumer

CONDITION VARIABLE:
- Thread coordination mechanism
- Wait for specific conditions
- Always use with mutex

READ-WRITE LOCK:
- Multiple readers OR single writer
- Optimizes read-heavy workloads
- More complex than mutex

ATOMIC OPERATIONS:
- Hardware-level synchronization
- Lock-free programming
- Simple operations only (increment, compare-and-swap)
```

### When to Use What
```
Use PROCESSES when:
- Strong fault isolation needed
- Security boundaries required
- Different programming languages
- Legacy system integration
- CPU-intensive independent tasks

Use THREADS when:
- Shared state is beneficial
- Frequent communication needed
- Resource efficiency important
- I/O-bound operations
- GUI applications (event handling)

Use THREAD POOLS when:
- Many short-lived tasks
- Want to limit resource usage
- Server applications
- Background job processing

Use ASYNC/EVENT-DRIVEN when:
- High concurrency with I/O
- Single-threaded performance adequate
- Network servers
- Real-time systems
```

### Common Patterns
```
Producer-Consumer:
- Decouples production from consumption
- Uses buffers and synchronization
- Good for pipeline processing

Reader-Writer:
- Multiple readers, exclusive writers
- Optimizes read-heavy workloads
- Database-like access patterns

Worker Pool:
- Fixed set of worker threads/processes
- Task queue for work distribution
- Controls resource usage

Pipeline:
- Sequential stages of processing
- Each stage runs concurrently
- Stream processing applications

Fork-Join:
- Divide work into parallel tasks
- Join results at the end
- Recursive algorithms, map-reduce
```

### System Calls Quick Reference
```
Process Management:
fork()     - Create child process
exec()     - Replace process image
wait()     - Wait for child termination
exit()     - Terminate process
getpid()   - Get process ID

Thread Management:
pthread_create()  - Create new thread
pthread_join()    - Wait for thread completion
pthread_detach()  - Mark thread for auto-cleanup
pthread_exit()    - Terminate calling thread
pthread_self()    - Get thread ID

Synchronization:
pthread_mutex_lock/unlock()    - Mutex operations
sem_wait/post()                - Semaphore operations
pthread_cond_wait/signal()     - Condition variables
```

Remember: Choose the right concurrency model based on your specific requirements for performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and development complexity!
