## ✅ Solution: Curves on Potatoes

Yes — you can draw such identical curves.

Here’s how: **intersect the potatoes**!

Think of the potatoes as holograms and slowly bring them together until they overlap in space. Now, look at the intersection of their surfaces — this will describe one or more closed curves that lie on both surfaces simultaneously.

Those curves are, by construction, identical in 3D space and lie on the surface of each potato.
