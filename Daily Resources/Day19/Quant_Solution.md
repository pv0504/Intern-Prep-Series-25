## Solution: Three Negatives

Let $a$ and $b$ be the only two negative numbers in the set, and let the sum of all the numbers be $S$.
We are told that:

* $a > S - a$ and
* $b > S - b$

Adding the two inequalities:

$$
a + b > (S - a) + (S - b) = 2S - a - b
$$

$$
\Rightarrow a + b > 2S - a - b \Rightarrow 2(a + b) > 2S \Rightarrow a + b > S
$$

But this is a contradiction, since $a + b$ is negative and $S$ includes many other (positive) numbers.
Hence, **there must be at least three negative numbers** in the set.
