# ðŸ§  Quant Puzzle â€“ Day 4

## ðŸ“Œ Topic: Another four bugs problem? 

### ðŸ¤” Whatâ€™s the Puzzle?

Suppose you are given **four lines** in a plane in general position â€” that means:

* No two lines are parallel.
* No three lines intersect at a single point.

On each line, a **ghost bug** starts at some random point and crawls at some constant velocity (possibly different for each one).

Being ghosts, if two bugs happen to meet at some place, they just pass through each other uninterrupted.

Now, as each pair of bugs can meet, there are $\binom{4}{2}$ = 6 possible bug meetings which can happen. Suppose that 5 of these 6 bug meetings happen. Prove that the sixth pair must meet as well.

### ðŸ’¡ Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Consider constructing a time axis perpendicular to the plane where the bugs move. What does the path of a bug look like in this new 3D space-time graph?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Each bugâ€™s movement now corresponds to a line in this 3D space. What does it mean geometrically if two bugs meet at some point in time?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Use **coplanarity** : if enough 3D lines intersect in pairs, they must lie in the same plane. What happens then?
