## Solution: Another four bugs problem? 

Construct a time axis perpendicular to the plane in which the bugs move. Each bug, crawling at constant speed along a line, traces out a straight line in 3D space-time. Its projection onto the original plane is the line it moves along. Now, observe that two bugs meet if and only if their 3D lines intersect.

Suppose all six possible bug meetings occur except the one between bug 3 and bug 4.

Let $g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4$ be the space-time lines of the four bugs.

From the given:

* $g_1, g_2, g_3$ intersect pairwise ⇒ they lie in a common plane.
* $g_1, g_2, g_4$ also intersect pairwise ⇒ they lie in a common plane.

Since both planes contain $g_1$ and $g_2$, they must be the same plane. Thus, all four lines $g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4$ lie in a single plane.

Now consider $g_3$ and $g_4$:

* Their projections (i.e., the original bug paths) are not parallel, so $g_3$ and $g_4$ are not parallel in 3D.
* Two non-parallel lines in a plane must intersect.

Therefore, $g_3$ and $g_4$ intersect in space-time. So the bugs 3 and 4 meet as well.

### Conclusion

The key idea in this solution is to introduce time as a new dimension allowing us to use the geometric properties of 3D space.
