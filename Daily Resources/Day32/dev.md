## Hands-On Tasks

### Task 1: Producer-Consumer Implementation
**Objective**: Implement and compare mutex vs semaphore solutions

**What to do**:
- Create a producer-consumer scenario with a shared buffer of size 5
- Implement using mutex + condition variables approach
- Implement using counting semaphores (empty, full) + binary semaphore (mutex)
- Test with 2 producers and 3 consumers
- Compare the two implementations and identify trade-offs
- Intentionally create race conditions by removing synchronization, observe the chaos

**Test scenario**: 
- Producers generate items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- Consumers print consumed items
- Run for 20 items total

**Expected outcome**: Understanding practical differences between synchronization mechanisms

### Task 2: Deadlock Analysis and Prevention
**Objective**: Create, detect, and resolve deadlock scenarios

**What to do**:
- Create a simple banking system simulation with 4 accounts (A, B, C, D)
- Implement 4 transfer threads that move money between accounts
- Design transfer operations that can cause deadlocks (hint: always lock accounts in same order can prevent this)
- Create a deadlock scenario where Thread1 transfers A→B, Thread2 transfers B→A simultaneously
- Implement deadlock detection using resource allocation graphs or timeout mechanisms
- Apply deadlock prevention by ordering resources (always lock lower account number first)
- Test both deadlock-prone and deadlock-free versions

**Expected outcome**: Hands-on experience with deadlock creation, detection, and prevention

## Key Concepts Reference

### Mutex Properties
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one thread can hold the lock
- **Ownership**: Only the thread that acquired the lock can release it
- **Blocking**: Threads wait if lock is unavailable
- **Binary Nature**: Either locked or unlocked

### Semaphore Types
- **Binary Semaphore**: Values 0 or 1, similar to mutex but no ownership
- **Counting Semaphore**: Can have values > 1, controls access to multiple resources
- **Operations**: P(wait/down) decrements, V(signal/up) increments

### Classic Problems
- **Producer-Consumer**: Synchronizing buffer access
- **Readers-Writers**: Multiple readers OR single writer
- **Dining Philosophers**: Avoiding deadlock with circular dependencies
- **Sleeping Barber**: Resource allocation with waiting

### Deadlock Conditions (All must be true)
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources cannot be shared
2. **Hold and Wait**: Process holds resources while waiting for others
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away
4. **Circular Wait**: Circular chain of processes waiting for each other

## Quick Implementation Patterns

### Mutex Pattern
```pseudocode
mutex.lock()
// Critical Section
// Access shared resource
mutex.unlock()
```

### Semaphore Pattern
```pseudocode
semaphore.wait()  // P operation
// Use resource
semaphore.signal()  // V operation
```

### Deadlock Prevention (Resource Ordering)
```pseudocode
// Always acquire resources in same order
if (resourceA_id < resourceB_id) {
    lock(resourceA)
    lock(resourceB)
} else {
    lock(resourceB)
    lock(resourceA)
}
```

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Race Conditions
- **Problem**: Shared data corruption due to timing
- **Solution**: Proper synchronization around shared data access

### Priority Inversion
- **Problem**: High priority task blocked by low priority task
- **Solution**: Priority inheritance or priority ceiling protocols

### Livelock
- **Problem**: Processes keep changing state but make no progress
- **Solution**: Randomized backoff or different resolution strategies

### Starvation in Synchronization
- **Problem**: Some threads never get access to resources
- **Solution**: Fair queuing or aging mechanisms

## Performance Considerations

### Mutex vs Semaphore Choice
- **Use Mutex when**: Protecting shared data, need ownership semantics
- **Use Semaphore when**: Controlling access to multiple resources, signaling between threads

### Granularity Trade-offs
- **Fine-grained locking**: Better concurrency, more complex, higher overhead
- **Coarse-grained locking**: Simpler, less concurrency, potential bottlenecks
