## 📌 Topic: Faulty Number Lock

### 🤔 What's the Puzzle?

A number lock with three dials, each numbered 1 through 8, is defective in that you only need to get two of the numbers right to open the lock.

What is the minimum number of (three-number) combinations you need to try in order to be sure of opening the lock?

### 💡 Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Think geometrically! The space of all possible combinations can be visualized as an 8 × 8 × 8 cube. Each test combination you try covers not just that single point, but also creates "lines" of coverage through the cube.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Consider partitioning the numbers 1-8 into two groups: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {5, 6, 7, 8}. The correct combination must have at least two numbers from one of these groups. Can you exploit this structure?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Consider how the sum of the three dial numbers modulo 4 can be used to select a subset of combinations that “covers” all possibilities.
