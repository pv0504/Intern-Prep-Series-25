## Overview
Hi, I’m **Vishakha Agarwal**. This summer, I had the opportunity to intern at AlphaGrep Securities as a Quant Researcher in their Gurgaon office. AlphaGrep offers both Quant Research and Software Engineering roles.

## Selection Process
1. **Online Assessment (OA)**  
   - Focus areas: Graph algorithms, dynamic programming, search & sorting.  
   - Recommendation: Solve the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)—many OA questions are variations of those problems.

2. **Technical Interviews**  
   - **Number of rounds**: 4  
   - **Duration**: Between 20 minutes and 1 hour each  
   - **Topics covered**:  
     - **Mental math** under time pressure  
     - **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Given a problem statement, discuss the most appropriate data structure and algorithm, and analyze time complexity  
     - **Probability**: Be prepared for questions on distributions and their properties (revise **MTL106** thoroughly)  
     - **Project discussion**: Explain your projects clearly—aim, methodology, and results  

## Key Topics to Revise
- **Graphs**: Traversals, shortest paths, topological sort  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Common patterns and optimizations  
- **Searching & Sorting**: Binary search, quicksort, mergesort, etc.  
- **Probability & Statistics**: Discrete and continuous distributions, expectation, variance  
- **Mental Math**: Quick calculations under pressure  

## Recommended Resources
- **Math Puzzles & Brain Teasers**  
  - Xinfeng Zhou’s puzzle collections  
  - Quant Guide  
  - Puzzled Quant  

- **Coding Practice**  
  - CSES Problem Set  
  - Medium-level LeetCode problems  
  - Timed practice on Codeforces contests  

## CV & Project Preparation
- **Structure** your CV with:  
  - Clear project titles  
  - A concise **aim** for each project  
  - A summary of the **methodology** used  
  - Key **outcomes** and metrics  

- **Be ready** to walk through any project on your CV—explain your approach and results fluently.

## Interview Tips
- **Communicate clearly**: Don’t think silently—talk through your thought process.  
- **Ask clarifying questions** if any problem statement is ambiguous.  
- **Accept hints**: Interviewers often guide you when you’re stuck.  
- **Be honest**: It’s okay to admit if you don’t know something; interviewers appreciate candor.

## Final Advice
- **Discuss OA problems** with friends—peer discussion can uncover new insights.  
- **Take care of your health**: The internship season can be intense with many assessments.  
- **Stay calm**: At the end of the day, it’s just an internship.  
- **All the best!**
