# 🧠 Quant Puzzle – Day 5

## 📌 Topic: Chef's Delight

### 🤔 What’s the Puzzle?

Level 1:  
a group of students are sitting in a circle with the teacher in the center. They all have an even number of candies(not necessarily equal). When the teacher blows a whistle, each student passes half his candies to the student on his left. Then the students who have an odd number of candies obtain an extra candy from the teacher. Would all the students ever have the same number of candies after a finite number of whistles

Level 2:  
You are chef for a day. There are 1024 different dishes you can make, but you need to pick 10 for the dinner menu. You've emailed the 3775 attendees a list of all the dishes and asked them to rank all the dishes in order of their preference (ranks go all the way from 1,2,3 … to …1024)

Now, you're trying to make a list of 10 dishes, let's call it List L. This list should have a special quality: if there's a dish 'd' that's not on List L, and you compare 'd' to the dishes on List L in a vote, then at least half of the people should like one of the dishes on List L more than 'd'. Different people might prefer different dishes.
