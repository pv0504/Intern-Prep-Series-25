- Identify and document each major boot stage with timestamps
- Use `systemd-analyze` to create boot timing diagrams
- Compare boot times with and without certain services
- Create a timeline showing: BIOS/UEFI → Boot Loader → Kernel → Init System → Services
- Examine boot configuration files (`/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, `/etc/fstab`, systemd units)
- Document hardware detection sequence and driver loading order

**Analysis points**:
- Which stage takes the longest time?
- What services are started in parallel vs sequentially?
- How does the system handle hardware detection failures?

**Expected outcome**: Complete understanding of real-world boot sequence timing and dependencies

### Task 2: Custom Boot Environment Creation

- Create a simple init system that:
  - Mounts essential filesystems (/proc, /sys, /dev)
  - Starts a basic shell
  - Displays system information
- Test the boot process in a virtual machine
- Modify boot parameters and observe changes
- Create multiple boot entries with different configurations
- Implement basic error handling for boot failures

**Components to create**:
