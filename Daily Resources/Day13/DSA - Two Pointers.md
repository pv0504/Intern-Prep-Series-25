# 📘 DSA Problem of the Day – Two Pointers Special (02/06/2025)

## 🔍 Focus: Mastering the Two Pointers Technique

The **Two Pointers** technique is a classic and efficient approach used to solve array and string problems. It uses two indices to traverse data—either from both ends or with one fast and one slow pointer. This technique often reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

### 🧠 Common Patterns
- Opposite Ends (e.g., sorted arrays)
- Same Direction (e.g., slow/fast pointers)
- Sliding Window (dynamic two pointers)

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Sorted Arrays Help**: Many problems become easier with sorted inputs.
- **Move Intelligently**: Know when to move the left or right pointer based on conditions.
- **Sliding Window = Dynamic Two Pointers**: Useful for substring and subarray problems.
- **Draw It Out**: Visualizing the movement of pointers helps avoid mistakes.
- **Watch Edge Cases**: Especially when pointers overlap or when dealing with duplicates.
