## Hands-On Tasks

### Task 1: Network Service Discovery and Protocol Analysis
**Objective**: Understand how services use ports and protocols in real systems

**What to do**:
- Use `netstat -tuln` or `ss -tuln` to list all listening ports on your system
- Identify and categorize services by their port numbers:
  - Web servers (80, 443, 8080, etc.)
  - Database servers (3306, 5432, 1521, etc.)
  - System services (22, 53, 25, etc.)
  - Custom applications (high port numbers)
- Use `nmap` to scan your local network and discover active services
- For each discovered service, document:
  - Protocol used (TCP/UDP)
  - Default port number
  - Service purpose and common configurations
- Use Wireshark to capture traffic for different protocols:
  - HTTP traffic (browse to a website)
  - DNS queries (use `nslookup` or `dig`)
  - SSH connections (connect to a server)
  - ICMP packets (use `ping`)
- Analyze packet headers and identify:
  - Source and destination IP addresses
  - Source and destination ports
  - Protocol-specific headers and data

**Analysis questions**:
- Which ports are most commonly used on your network?
- How do ephemeral ports get assigned to client connections?
- What's the difference between TCP and UDP packet structures?

**Expected outcome**: Practical understanding of how services use ports and protocols in real networks

### Task 2: Socket Programming and Network Communication
**Objective**: Implement basic client-server communication using sockets

**What to do**:
- Create a simple TCP echo server that:
  - Binds to a specific port (e.g., 8888)
  - Accepts client connections
  - Echoes back any data received from clients
  - Handles multiple clients (use threading or async)
- Create a corresponding TCP client that:
  - Connects to the server
  - Sends user input to the server
  - Displays the echoed response
- Implement the same functionality using UDP sockets
- Test your implementations and observe the differences:
  - Connection establishment (TCP vs UDP)
  - Data delivery guarantees
  - Error handling and recovery
- Use network monitoring tools while testing:
  - `netstat` to see active connections
  - `tcpdump` to capture packets
  - `lsof` to see which process is using which port
- Experiment with different scenarios:
  - Multiple clients connecting simultaneously
  - Network interruptions (disconnect/reconnect)
  - Large data transfers
  - Different IP addresses (localhost vs network IPs)

**Implementation languages** (choose one):
- Python: Use `socket` module
- Java: Use `java.net.Socket` and `java.net.ServerSocket`
- C/C++: Use BSD sockets API
- JavaScript: Use Node.js with `net` module

**Expected outcome**: Hands-on experience with socket programming and understanding of TCP vs UDP differences
