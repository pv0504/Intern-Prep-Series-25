# 📘 DSA Problem of the Day – DSU Special (03/07/2025)

## 🔍 Focus: Mastering Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)

Union-Find (DSU) supports fast connectivity and component-merging operations. It underpins Kruskal’s MST, dynamic connectivity, cycle detection, and many offline graph-query techniques.

## 💡 Tips for DSU

- **Path Compression & Union by Rank**  
  Always compress paths in `find()` and merge smaller rank under larger to achieve near-constant amortized time.

- **Use Cases**  
  - Kruskal’s MST  
  - Offline connectivity queries (Mo’s algorithm on trees)  
  - Cycle detection in undirected graphs  
  - Maintaining bipartiteness with DSU + parity arrays

- **Advanced Variants**  
  - **Rollback DSU** for divide-and-conquer offline queries  
  - **Persistent DSU** stores history for time-travel queries  
  - **DSU on Tree** to answer subtree queries by merging child components
