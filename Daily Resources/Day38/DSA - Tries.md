# 📘 DSA Problem of the Day – Trie Special (03/07/2025)

## 🔍 Focus: Mastering Trie (Prefix Tree) Structures

Tries (prefix trees) enable fast insertion and lookup of strings or bit-patterns. They power autocomplete, dictionary-matching, and bitwise-trie XOR optimizations.

## 💡 Tips for Tries

- **Node Structure**  
  Use fixed‐size arrays for small alphabets, or hash/dictionary for large character sets.

- **Augmenting Tries**  
  - Store counts: how many words pass through a node for prefix-count queries  
  - Store end-of-word markers and word-indices for retrieval

- **Bitwise Trie**  
  For XOR-maximization problems, insert 32-bit integers into a binary trie to query best complement in O(bit-width).

- **Memory Considerations**  
  Tries can be memory-heavy; use compression (radix/DAWG) or dynamic child-maps when alphabet is sparse.
