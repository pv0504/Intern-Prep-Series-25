# 📘 DSA Problem of the Day – Sliding Window Technique (28/05/2025)

## 🔍 Focus: Mastering the Sliding Window Technique

The sliding window technique optimizes array/string problems by maintaining a "window" of elements and sliding it to avoid recomputation. Ideal for:
- Subarray/substring problems
- Contiguous sequences with constraints (e.g., max sum, min length)
- Fixed or variable window sizes

## 💡 Tips for Success
- **Window Maintenance**: Always ensure your window is valid (satisfies the problem's constraints) before updating the answer.
- **Two Pointers**: Sliding window often involves two pointers (left and right) to represent the current window.
- **Hash Maps**: For problems involving character frequency, use hash maps to keep track of counts efficiently.
- **Deque for Maximum/Minimum**: Use a deque to maintain the maximum or minimum in a sliding window for O(N) time complexity.
- **Edge Cases**: Pay attention to edge cases like empty strings, all identical characters, or K=0.
