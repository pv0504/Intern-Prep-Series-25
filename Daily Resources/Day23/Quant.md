### ðŸ¤” What's the Puzzle?

You want to join a certain chess club, but admission requires that you play three games against Ioana, the current club champion â€” and win two games in a row.

A coin is flipped, and the result is:
You will be White in the first and third games, Black in the second.

Should you be happy?
