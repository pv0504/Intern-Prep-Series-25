## ✅ Solution: Wins in a Row

You can answer this question by assigning a variable $w$ to the probability of winning a game as White, and another variable $b < w$ to the probability of winning as Black — then doing some algebra.

But here’s a clever shortcut using coupling.

Imagine playing four games against Ioana, with the color sequence:
White, Black, White, Black.

You still need to win two in a row, but you decide in advance to ignore either the first or the last game.

* Ignoring the first game is equivalent to playing the original 3-game sequence **BWB**.
* Ignoring the last game is equivalent to playing **WBW**.

So we now compare the outcomes under a single experiment.

The only scenarios where your choice of which game to ignore makes a difference are:

* **WWLX**: You win the first two, lose (or draw) the third — you wish you'd ignored the last game.
* **XLWW**: You lose the second, then win the last two — you wish you'd ignored the first game.

In both cases, you get two wins (one as White, one as Black), so they’re symmetric *except* for the loss:

* In **WWLX**, the loss is with White (less likely),
* In **XLWW**, the loss is with Black (more likely).

Thus, **XLWW is more likely** than WWLX.

So you're better off ignoring the first game — that is, playing Black in the first game.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**No**, you shouldn't be happy.
You’d have a better chance if you started as Black, i.e., played the **BWB** sequence.
