## üí° Tips for Success

- **Understand the Problem**: Before jumping into coding, ensure you comprehend the problem statement and constraints.

- **Identify Monotonicity**: Binary search works best on problems with monotonic properties‚Äîwhere the function is strictly increasing or decreasing.

- **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Carefully update your search boundaries (`low` and `high`) to prevent infinite loops.

- **Test Edge Cases**: Always test your implementation with edge cases to ensure correctness.

- **Practice Regularly**: Consistent practice with a variety of problems will solidify your understanding and improve your problem-solving skills.
