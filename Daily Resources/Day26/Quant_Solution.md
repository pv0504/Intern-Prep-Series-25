## ✅ Solution: Who Won the Series?

You could work this out by letting $p > \frac{1}{2}$ be the probability of winning a home game, then crunch numbers.

But no calculation is actually necessary — remember this key idea:
Home-field advantage in potential games is just as valuable as it is in games that are guaranteed to be played.

If you only knew that *at most* 6 games were played, you'd say that Team A and Team B were equally likely to have won.
But if you knew that *at most* 5 games were played, Team B (host of 3 games) would be the more likely winner.

From these two facts, it follows that if *exactly* 6 games were played, then Team A is more likely to have won the series.

Alternatively, suppose the home-field advantage is extremely large — so much that only a miracle allows the away team to win.

In that case, it's likely that just one “miracle” upset happened across the six games.

That upset couldn't have been in Game 1 or 2 — otherwise Team B would’ve won in just 5 games.

So the upset had to occur in Game 3, 4, 5, or 6 — and in the first three of those, it’s Team A who benefitted.

Hence, Team A is more likely the winner.
