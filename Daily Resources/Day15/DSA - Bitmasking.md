## 🧮 Must-Know Bitwise Operations

| Operation     | Syntax           | Description                        |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| AND          | a & b          | 1 only if both bits are 1          |
| OR           | a | b          | 1 if either bit is 1               |
| XOR          | a ^ b          | 1 if bits are different            |
| NOT          | ~a             | Inverts bits                       |
| Left Shift   | a << n         | Multiplies a by 2^n            |
| Right Shift  | a >> n         | Divides a by 2^n               |
| Check Bit    | (a >> i) & 1   | Checks if the i-th bit is set     |
| Set Bit      | a | (1 << i)   | Sets the i-th bit                 |
| Clear Bit    | a & ~(1 << i)  | Clears the i-th bit               |
| Toggle Bit   | a ^ (1 << i)   | Flips the i-th bit                |

## 🧰 Tips & Tricks

- 2^n is always greater than the sum of all smaller powers of 2:  
  \[
  2^n > 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^{n-1}
  \]

- Identity: x ^ x = 0 for any integer x. This is frequently used to cancel out values.

- Use __builtin_popcount(mask) in C++ to count number of set bits in a mask.

- Represent subsets of a size-n set using masks from 0 to (1 << n) - 1.

- Think of bitmasks as binary arrays — AND/OR/XOR operations model subset logic, toggling, and conditional selection.
