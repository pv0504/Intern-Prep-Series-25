## Solution
We want to find the expected cards after the first 2 that we obtain the first ace. Therefore, our first task is to figure out how many cards that aren't ranked A or 2 on average. We have 8 dividers, which are precisely all of the rank A and 2 cards. These dividers split our deck up into 9 regions. There are 44 cards left that are not ranked A or 2, so as we have that the regions have equal size in expectation, the expected length of each region is 44/9. 

Now, we need to find the expected number of regions that appear between the first 2 and ace. We now do first ace again on the dividers. We know that one of the 2s showed up already, so we only have 7 dividers left. We want to find the expected number of 2s before the first ace, so the aces are our dividers now. The 4 aces divide up our subset into 5 regions. We have 3 2s left, so there are on average 3/5 2s per region. However, we already know that one 2 appeared, so we must add 1 to the number of regions that there will be. Therefore, our expected number of regions is 8/5. 

However, we also need to account for the dividers, as we did not count for them previously when computing 44/9. The average number of dividers that appear after the first 2 is 3/5, so we just add that in above. Putting this all together, the expected number of cards between them is 44/9 * 8/5 + 3/5 = 379/45.
