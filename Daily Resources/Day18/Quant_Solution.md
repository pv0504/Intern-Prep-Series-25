## Solution: Peek Advantage

Without the peek, the bet is fair—that is, your expected gain is \$0.
If your peek reveals a red card on the bottom, you will of course bet on black and be right with probability 26/51; then your expectation will be:

$$
\frac{26}{51} \cdot \$100 + \frac{25}{51} \cdot (-\$100) \approx \$1.96.
$$

Since the calculation is the same if the card on the bottom is black, the value of the information is **\$1.96**.

We can do a similar calculation for peeking at two cards, but why bother? The second peek is worthless! Suppose the bottom card is red. If the next-to-bottom card is red, then of course you still bet that the top card is black. If the next-to-bottom card is black, then you’re back to a fair game, so you may as well keep your plan of betting on black.

Since the second peek does not have the power to change your strategy, its additional value to you is **exactly \$0**.

### Try this puzzle next with a similar line of reasoning :

Before you are two coins; one is a fair coin, and the other is biased
toward heads. You’d like to try to figure out which is which, and to
do so you are permitted two flips. Should you flip each coin once, or
one coin twice?
