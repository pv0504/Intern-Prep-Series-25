# 🔀 git merge: Combine with context

## 📌 Scenario:
You're working on a feature in `feature/login-ui`, and now you want to bring your work into `main`.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/login-ui
```

### ✅ Pros:
- Keeps full history. Great when you want context of how things came together.
- Easy and safe. No rewriting.

### ❗ Merge Conflict?
Git will shout:

```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Login.js
```

Solve manually → `git add` → `git commit`

🛠 Fix tip: Use VS Code or a GUI tool for your first few merge conflicts!

## 🪄 git rebase: Rewrite for clarity

### 📌 Scenario:
You’re 10 commits into `feature/login-ui`. But the main branch moved on. You want your changes to appear like they were built on top of the latest `main`.

```bash
git checkout feature/login-ui
git rebase main
```

This:
1. Re-applies your commits on top of `main`
2. Makes the history linear, clean

### 🧠 Use when:
- You want a clean commit history.
- BEFORE merging feature → main.
- Working solo or before push (never rebase shared history)

### ❗ If you see:

```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Login.js
```

Same as merge: fix → `git add` → `git rebase --continue`

## 🧳 git stash: Your code’s “locker room”

### 📌 Scenario:
You’re halfway into something, and suddenly your mentor says:

> "Switch to the `hotfix/footer-bug` branch, NOW."

You can’t commit unfinished junk.

```bash
git stash
```

Boom—your changes are safely tucked away.

Now switch:

```bash
git checkout hotfix/footer-bug
```

Come back later:

```bash
git stash pop
```

✅ Also great if your changes are breaking stuff and you want to quickly reset.

## 🌱 Practical Branching Workflow

### Real-world branch naming:

| Purpose      | Example Branch Name     |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Feature      | `feature/signup-form`   |
| Bugfix       | `bugfix/navbar-overlap` |
| Hotfix       | `hotfix/prod-crash`     |
| Experimental | `wip/test-new-ui`       |

### Workflow:

```bash
# Create and switch
git checkout -b feature/signup-form

# Work, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add basic signup UI"

# Stay updated
git pull origin main --rebase

# Final merge (back to main)
git checkout main
git merge feature/signup-form
```

## 🧠 Core Concepts You MUST Know

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| clone | Copy repo from remote |
| pull | Fetch + merge changes |
| fetch | Just get remote changes, don’t merge |
| add | Stage files |
| commit | Snapshot staged changes |
| push | Upload local commits to remote |
| log | Show commit history |
| diff | See what's changed |
| status | See current changes |
| revert | Undo a commit (safe) |
| reset | Rewind history (destructive) |

## ❗ Pro Tips for Internship-Ready Git Users

| 🔥 DO THIS | 🚫 AVOID THIS |
|------------|---------------|
| Pull often with rebase: `git pull --rebase` | Merging without understanding |
| Write useful commit messages | `commit -m "fix"` everywhere |
| Use feature branches | Commit directly to `main` |
| Practice resolving conflicts | Panic at merge conflicts |
| Use stash when in-between | Force commit broken code |
| Clean up with interactive rebase | Push messy, spammy commit logs |

## ✅ Wrap-up: How to Practice

1. Every new task → make a new branch.  
2. Pair up with a friend: one merges, other rebases. Trigger & resolve conflicts.  
3. Build a habit: `git pull --rebase`, stash, merge, log, diff, and reset on toy projects.  
4. Learn one Git GUI tool (like GitKraken, SourceTree, or VS Code Git Panel).  
5. Do 1 Git Kata every day for 10 minutes: https://github.com/praqma-training/git-katas
