# üìò DSA Problem of the Day ‚Äì Dynamic Programming Special (24/05/2025)

## üîç Focus: Mastering Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computation. It‚Äôs a key skill in competitive programming and coding interviews.

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Understand the Recurrence**: Think recursively before coding. Understand how a problem can be broken into subproblems.
- **Start Small**: Begin with simple DP problems to build confidence.
- **Recognize DP Patterns**: Many problems fit into common templates‚Äîknapsack, LIS, matrix path, etc.
- **Memoization vs Tabulation**: Understand when to use top-down (memoization) or bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
- **Draw the State Space**: Visualize the states and transitions with tables or recursion trees.
- **Optimize When Needed**: Learn how to reduce space complexity using rolling arrays or state compression.
