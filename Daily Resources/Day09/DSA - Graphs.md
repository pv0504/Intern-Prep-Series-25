# ðŸ“˜ DSA Problem of the Day â€“ Graphs Special (30/05/2025)
ðŸ”— **Focus: Mastering Graph Algorithms**

Graphs are everywhereâ€”networks, social media, navigation, and more. Mastering graph theory and algorithms is essential for success in competitive programming, technical interviews, and real-world problem solving.

## ðŸ“š Learning Resources

### ðŸ“Œ Graph Basics
Understand the fundamentals of graphs: nodes, edges, adjacency lists/matrices, and traversal techniques.

- [GeeksforGeeks: Graph Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/)
- [CP-Algorithms: Graphs](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/)
- [Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook â€“ Antti Laaksonen (PDF)](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

> ðŸ’¡ *Reading CP-Algorithms and the CP Handbook is more than enough to build strong fundamentals in graphsâ€”thatâ€™s what I personally followed. It has almost all the algorithms that one might need to solve graph questions but feel free to explore other resources for better clarity or alternative explanations.*

### ðŸ”„ Traversal Algorithms
Learn BFS and DFS, the two core techniques to explore graphs.

- [BFS vs DFS â€“ GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/)
- [Visualgo: Graph Traversal](https://visualgo.net/en/dfsbfs)

### ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Graph Topics
Cover shortest paths, cycles, connected components, and more.

- [Dijkstra's & Bellman-Ford Algorithms â€“ GfG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-path-algorithms/)
- [Topological Sort â€“ CP-Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/topological-sort.html)
- [Union-Find / DSU â€“ GfG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find/)

## ðŸ§© Practice Problems (CSES â€“ Increasing Difficulty)

To Practice Graphs CSES contains one of the best set of problems as it helps you build the visualisation by gradually incrasing difficulty and it has questions on almost all important graph algorithms. [CSES Graph Algorithms section](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/graph/):

1. **[Counting Rooms](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1192/)** â€“ *Easy*  
   ðŸ§  **Idea:** Count connected components of empty cells (`.`) using DFS/BFS in a 2D grid.

2. **[Labyrinth](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1193/)** â€“ *Easy*  
   ðŸ§  **Idea:** Find the shortest path from `A` to `B` in a grid using BFS. Return the path as a sequence of moves.

3. **[Building Roads](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1666/)** â€“ *Easy*  
   ðŸ§  **Idea:** Count connected components and determine how many roads are needed to connect all cities.

4. **[Message Route](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1667/)** â€“ *Medium*  
   ðŸ§  **Idea:** Use BFS to find the shortest path from node 1 to node `n` in an unweighted graph.

5. **[Building Teams](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1668/)** â€“ *Medium*  
   ðŸ§  **Idea:** Check if a graph is bipartite to divide nodes into two teams with no internal conflicts.

6. **[Round Trip](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1669/)** â€“ *Medium*  
   ðŸ§  **Idea:** Detect a cycle in an undirected graph using DFS. Return the cycle if found.

7. **[Monsters](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1694/)** â€“ *Medium/Hard*  
   ðŸ§  **Idea:** Escape the grid from monsters. Use multi-source BFS to calculate monster arrival times and compare with playerâ€™s movement.

8. **[Shortest Route II](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1672/)** â€“ *Medium/Hard*  
   ðŸ§  **Idea:** Compute all-pairs shortest paths using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

9. **[High Score](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1673/)** â€“ *Hard*  
   ðŸ§  **Idea:** Use Bellman-Ford to find the longest path in a graph. Watch out for positive weight cycles.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- **Visualize the Graph:** Always sketch the graph for clarity.
- **Pick the Right Representation:** Use adjacency list for sparse graphs and adjacency matrix for dense ones.
- **Know the Properties:** Is the graph directed, weighted, cyclic? Tailor your approach accordingly.
- **Use Visited Sets:** Avoid infinite loops by marking visited nodes.
- **Practice Variants:** Implement each algorithm in different formsâ€”iterative and recursive.
- **Debug with Small Inputs:** Trace through small examples to catch bugs early.
