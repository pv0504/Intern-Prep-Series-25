# ðŸ§  Quant Puzzle â€“ Day 20

## ðŸ“Œ Topic: Coin Triplets

### ðŸ¤” What's the Puzzle?

You're playing a coin-tossing game where you flip a fair coin repeatedly until one of the following patterns appears:

- `HHH` â€” three heads in a row
- `THH` â€” a tail followed by two heads

The game stops when the **first** of these two patterns appears.

**What is the probability that `HHH` appears before `THH`?**

Think of modeling the problem using a **Markov chain** with states based on the latest outcomes (`S`, `H`, `HH`, `T`, `TH`, etc). Track transitions until one of the absorbing states (`HHH` or `THH`) is reached.
