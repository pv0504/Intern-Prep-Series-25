## ðŸ“Œ Topic: Overflowing Buckets

### ðŸ¤” What's the Puzzle?

Before you are 12 two-gallon buckets and a 1-gallon scoop. At each
turn, you may fill the scoop with water and distribute the water any
way you like among the buckets.
However, each time you do this your opponent will empty two
buckets of her choice.
You win if you can get one of the big buckets to overflow. Can you
force a win? If so, how long will it take you?

fullest two buckets. To force your opponent to pour out as little water
as possible, itâ€™s natural to begin by keeping all the buckets at the same
level. How far will this get you?
