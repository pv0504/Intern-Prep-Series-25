# 📘 DSA Problem of the Day – Stack Technique (07/06/2025)

## 🔍 Focus: Mastering the Stack Data Structure

**Stacks** are linear data structures that follow the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle. They're crucial for solving problems involving:

- Reversals (strings, linked lists)
- Matching delimiters (parentheses, tags)
- Tracking state changes (undo, backtracking)
- Next/Previous Greater/Smaller Element
- Monotonic Stack patterns

## 💡 Tips for Success

- ✅ **Use STL/Collections**: In C++, use `std::stack`; in Python, use `list` or `collections.deque`.
- 📉 **Monotonic Stack**: For "next greater/smaller" problems, maintain increasing or decreasing stack.
- ✍️ **Expression Parsing**: Use two stacks for evaluating complex expressions.
- 🔁 **Two-Pass Trick**: Traverse from both ends when solving "next/previous" related problems.
- 🧱 **Custom Structures**: Store indices, values, or frequency objects in stack where needed.
