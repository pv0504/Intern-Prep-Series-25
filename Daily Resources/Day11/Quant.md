## ðŸ“Œ Topic: Game of Divisors

### ðŸ¤” What's the Puzzle?

Two immensely intelligent players, **A** & **B**, engage in a game governed by the following rules:

For some natural number **N**, a board is created consisting of numbers from **1** to **N**. Each player takes turns to strike off a (new) number from the board. But there's a twist:

> Whenever a player strikes off a number, they must also strike off **all its divisors** â€” even if some were already removed earlier.

The player who strikes off the **last remaining number** on the board **wins** the game. Can **A** construct a winning strategy?
