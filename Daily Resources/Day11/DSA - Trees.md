## 🧩 Practice Problems (CSES – Increasing Difficulty)



CSES contains a great set of **tree problems**, focusing on implementation, understanding recursion, and using tree properties. [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/)



1.  **[Subordinates](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1674)** – *Easy*

🧠 **Idea:** Use DFS to traverse the company tree and count the size of each subtree (excluding the node itself), which equals the number of subordinates for each employee.



2.  **[Tree Matching](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1130)** – *Easy*

🧠 **Idea:** Use DP on Trees: For each node, maintain two states – `dp[node][0]` (max matching if node is **not** matched) and `dp[node][1]` (max matching if node **is** matched with a child).



3.  **[Tree Diameter](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1131)** – *Easy*

🧠 **Idea:** Run **2 DFS** – first to find the farthest node, second from that node to compute the **diameter**.



4.  **[Tree Distances II](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1133)** – *Medium/Hard*

🧠 **Idea:** Use **2 DFS passes** – first to compute subtree sizes & distances from root, second to **reroot** and update answers for all nodes. Use some transition formula to get answer for rerooted tree!



5.  **[Company Queries I](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1687)** – *Medium*

🧠 **Idea:** Use Binary Lifting (precompute 2ⁱ-th ancestors) to answer each query in logarithmic time.



6.  **[Company Queries II](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1688)** – *Medium/Hard*

🧠 **Idea:** Use Binary Lifting with depth preprocessing to compute LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) in logarithmic time per query.


7.  **[Distance Queries](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1135)** – *Hard*

🧠 **Idea:** Use **Binary Lifting** to find **LCA**, then compute distance as:  
`dist(a, b) = depth[a] + depth[b] - 2 * depth[lca(a, b)]`

## 💡 Tips for Success



-   **Visualize the Tree:** Draw tree structures for clarity and better debugging.

-   **Recursive Thinking:** Most tree problems are elegantly solved with recursion or DFS.

-   **Preprocessing Helps:** Binary lifting, Euler tours, and subtree sizes can help reduce time complexity.

-   **Understand Tree Properties:** Balanced? Binary? Ordered? Tailor your solution accordingly.

-   **Practice Variants:** Implement iterative and recursive tree traversals to solidify your concepts.

-   **Debug on Simple Trees:** Use small inputs or hand-drawn trees to validate your approach.
