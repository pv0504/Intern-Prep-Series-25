# 🧠 Quant Puzzle – Day 6

## 📌 Topic: Infected Checkerboard

### 🤔 What’s the Puzzle?

An infection spreads on an $n \times n$ checkerboard as follows:
Any square with two or more infected neighbors becomes infected itself. (Neighbours are orthogonal only, so each square has at most 4 neighbours.)

For example, suppose that we begin with all $n$ squares on the main diagonal infected. Then the infection will spread to neighboring diagonals and eventually to the whole board

Prove that you cannot infect the whole board if you begin with fewer than $n$ infected squares.
