## Hands-On Tasks

### Task 1: TCP Handshake Analysis and Visualization
**Objective**: Capture and analyze real TCP handshakes in detail

**What to do**:
- Set up Wireshark to capture network traffic on your interface
- Create a simple client-server connection (use telnet, web browser, or write simple socket code)
- Capture the complete connection lifecycle: establishment → data transfer → termination
- Analyze the captured packets and document:
  - Initial sequence numbers for both client and server
  - Window sizes and how they change
  - Timing between SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets
  - Data transfer patterns and acknowledgments
  - Connection termination sequence (FIN, FIN-ACK, ACK, ACK)
- Create a timeline diagram showing packet exchange
- Identify retransmissions (if any) and analyze their timing
- Use `netstat -an` or `ss -tuln` to observe connection states during the process

**Analysis questions**:
- What are the initial sequence numbers chosen by client and server?
- How long does the complete handshake take?
- What happens if you forcefully close the connection?

**Expected outcome**: Deep understanding of packet-level TCP behavior and timing

### Task 2: TCP Connection State Monitoring and Simulation
**Objective**: Observe and simulate different TCP connection states and scenarios

**What to do**:
- Write a simple TCP server that listens on a port (use Python, Java, C, or any language)
- Write a client that connects to the server
- Use monitoring tools to observe connection states throughout the lifecycle
- Implement these scenarios and observe the results:
  - **Normal connection**: Complete handshake → data transfer → graceful close
  - **Connection timeout**: Client tries to connect to non-existent server
  - **Server overload**: Multiple clients connecting simultaneously
  - **Abrupt termination**: Kill client/server process during data transfer
  - **Half-open connection**: Disconnect network cable during active connection
- For each scenario, document:
  - TCP states observed on both client and server sides
  - How long connections stay in TIME_WAIT state
  - Retransmission behavior and timeouts
  - System resource usage (use `lsof` or `netstat` to count connections)

**Monitoring commands to use**:
- `netstat -ant | grep :PORT` - Show connections to specific port
- `ss -tuln` - Modern alternative to netstat
- `lsof -i :PORT` - Show processes using specific port

**Expected outcome**: Practical experience with TCP state machine and connection management

## TCP Packet Structure Reference

### TCP Header Fields
- **Source Port** (16 bits): Sending application port
- **Destination Port** (16 bits): Receiving application port
- **Sequence Number** (32 bits): Position of data in byte stream
- **Acknowledgment Number** (32 bits): Next expected sequence number
- **Window Size** (16 bits): Flow control - bytes receiver can accept
- **Flags** (9 bits): Control bits including SYN, ACK, FIN, RST
- **Checksum** (16 bits): Error detection for header and data
- **Options** (variable): Additional TCP features

### TCP Flags Explained
- **SYN** (Synchronize): Initiate connection, establish sequence numbers
- **ACK** (Acknowledge): Confirm receipt of data
- **FIN** (Finish): Gracefully close connection
- **RST** (Reset): Immediately terminate connection
- **PSH** (Push): Push data to application immediately
- **URG** (Urgent): Urgent data present

## Connection State Machine

### TCP States
1. **CLOSED** - No connection exists
2. **LISTEN** - Server waiting for connection requests
3. **SYN_SENT** - Client sent SYN, waiting for SYN-ACK
4. **SYN_RCVD** - Server received SYN, sent SYN-ACK, waiting for ACK
5. **ESTABLISHED** - Connection established, data transfer possible
6. **FIN_WAIT_1** - Application closed, sent FIN, waiting for ACK
7. **FIN_WAIT_2** - Received ACK for FIN, waiting for remote FIN
8. **CLOSE_WAIT** - Received FIN, waiting for application to close
9. **CLOSING** - Both sides closing simultaneously
10. **LAST_ACK** - Sent FIN after receiving FIN, waiting for final ACK
11. **TIME_WAIT** - Waiting for duplicate packets to expire

### Three-Way Handshake
```
Client                    Server
  |                         |
  |-------> SYN ----------->|  (SYN_SENT)
  |                         |  (SYN_RCVD)
  |<------ SYN-ACK <--------|
  |                         |
  |-------> ACK ----------->|  (ESTABLISHED)
  |                         |  (ESTABLISHED)
```

### Four-Way Termination
```
Client                    Server
  |                         |
  |-------> FIN ----------->|  (FIN_WAIT_1)
  |                         |  (CLOSE_WAIT)
  |<------- ACK <-----------|
  |                         |  (FIN_WAIT_2)
  |<------- FIN <-----------|  (LAST_ACK)
  |                         |
  |-------> ACK ----------->|  (TIME_WAIT)
  |                         |  (CLOSED)
```

## Common TCP Scenarios

### Normal Connection Lifecycle
1. **Server starts**: Enters LISTEN state
2. **Client connects**: Sends SYN (SYN_SENT state)
3. **Server responds**: Sends SYN-ACK (SYN_RCVD state)
4. **Client confirms**: Sends ACK (both enter ESTABLISHED)
5. **Data transfer**: Application data exchange
6. **Client closes**: Sends FIN (FIN_WAIT_1 state)
7. **Server acknowledges**: Sends ACK (CLOSE_WAIT state)
8. **Server closes**: Sends FIN (LAST_ACK state)
9. **Client confirms**: Sends ACK (TIME_WAIT state)

### Connection Problems and Solutions

#### SYN Flood Attack
- **Problem**: Attacker sends many SYN packets without completing handshake
- **Impact**: Server resources exhausted in SYN_RCVD state
- **Solution**: SYN cookies, rate limiting, firewall rules

#### Half-Open Connections
- **Problem**: One side thinks connection is closed, other side doesn't
- **Cause**: Network interruption, system crash, firewall
- **Detection**: Keepalive packets, application-level heartbeat

#### TIME_WAIT Accumulation
- **Problem**: Too many connections in TIME_WAIT state
- **Cause**: High connection churn, short-lived connections
- **Solution**: SO_REUSEADDR, connection pooling, adjust TIME_WAIT timeout

## Performance Considerations

### Connection Establishment Overhead
- **RTT Impact**: Handshake requires 1.5 round-trip times
- **Optimization**: Connection pooling, keep-alive connections
- **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3**: Multiplexing to reduce connection overhead

### Sequence Number Management
- **Initial Sequence Numbers**: Randomly chosen for security
- **Wraparound**: 32-bit sequence numbers wrap around
- **PAWS**: Protect Against Wrapped Sequence numbers

### Window Management
- **Flow Control**: Prevent overwhelming receiver
- **Congestion Control**: Adapt to network conditions
- **Window Scaling**: Support for large receive windows

## Security Implications

### TCP Sequence Number Attacks
- **Attack**: Predict sequence numbers to inject packets
- **Prevention**: Random initial sequence numbers, timestamps

### Connection Hijacking
- **Attack**: Take over established TCP connection
- **Prevention**: IPSec, TLS, proper firewall rules

### Denial of Service
- **SYN Flood**: Exhaust connection resources
- **Connection Exhaustion**: Open many connections
- **Prevention**: Rate limiting, SYN cookies, proper resource limits

## Troubleshooting TCP Issues

### Common Problems
- **Connection Refused**: Target port not listening
- **Connection Timeout**: Network unreachable or filtered
- **Connection Reset**: Application or firewall forcefully closed connection
- **Slow Connection**: Network congestion, flow control issues

### Diagnostic Tools
- **netstat/ss**: View current connections and listening ports
- **tcpdump/Wireshark**: Capture and analyze packets
- **telnet/nc**: Test basic connectivity
- **nmap**: Scan ports and test connectivity

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Connection establishment time**: How long handshake takes
- **Retransmission rate**: Percentage of packets retransmitted
- **Connection duration**: How long connections stay open
- **Concurrent connections**: Number of simultaneous connections
